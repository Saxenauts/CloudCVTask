#Visual Question Answering (VQA) 

Here is a simple code to demo VQA system using **Convolutional Neural Network(VGG -16)** to process images, a **Recurrent Neural Networks(Glove embeddings)** to process the question and a **Three Layer Feedforward Neural Network** to combine their results. The [VQA dataset](http://visualqa.org/) is then trained on this network. 

Built on python using Keras Framework on Theano backend. Additional webpage designed to showcase the demo, built on flask framework.

**[TODO]:**  

-[ ] Blog post explaining the intricacies of the architecture.
-[ ] Add functionality to upload images and test them.
-[ ] Write a script to enable downloading the project and running it.
-[ ] Provide a laconic description of the project on github readme.md
-[x] Comment the Code
