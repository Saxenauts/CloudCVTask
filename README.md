#Visual Question Answering (VQA) 

Simple Code to demo VQA system using **Convolutional Neural Network(VGG -16)** to process images, and a **Recurrent Neural Networks(Glove embeddings)** to process the question and a **Three layered Feedforward neural Network** to combine their results. The [VQA dataset](http://visualqa.org/) is then trained on this network. 

Built on python using Keras Framework on Theano backend. Additional webpage designed to showcase the demo, built on flask framework. 

[A much better and immaculate demo that inspired this one.](http://cloudcv.org/vqa)

**[TODO]:**  

1. Blog post explaining the intricacies of the architecture.
2. Add functionality to upload images and test them.
3. Write a script to enable downloading the project and running it.
4. Provide a laconic description of the project on github readme.md
